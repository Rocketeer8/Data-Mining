# Description
This project is separated into 2 parts:

1. Apply and determine the optimal regression machine learning algorithm to accurately forecast the percentage of hospitalized COVID patients, leveraging a dataset featuring attributes like previous-day COVID admissions, occupied hospital beds, and more.
2. Employ and determine the most effective classification machine learning algorithm for accurately predicting the sanction status of an individual's insurance claim. (based on features such as insurance agency name, agency net sales, insurance plan of the individual, etc).

# How to Run
- Launch Google Colab by visiting "colab.research.google.com" and sign in to your Google account if prompted.
- In the Colab interface, click on "File" and select "Open notebook" from the dropdown menu.
- From the options presented, choose "GitHub", then enter "Rocketeer8" in the search bar.
- Navigate to the "Data-Mining" repository and select the "Project.ipynb" notebook.
- You're now ready to view and interact with the notebook, which will display code segments along with their outputs.

Alternatively, Project.pdf in the repo also displays the result.

# What I Learned
- Understanding the mechanics of various regression machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forests. Additionally, delving into Classification machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- Handling data cleansing (missing values) and conducting data exploration.
- Employing strategies to select optimal features and implementing data dimension reduction techniques.
- Visualizing the results of machine learning accuracy rates to gain insights and communicate findings effectively.
